## 🎮 About The Game

MonkeyPaw is a dark comedy interactive web game based on the classic "Monkey's Paw" legend. Players make three wishes through a chat interface, and an AI-powered spirit grants each wish with malicious, ironic twists designed to make you regret ever finding the cursed paw.

### Game Features
- **🤖 AI-Powered**: Uses Google's Gemini API for creative, contextual responses
- **🎭 Dark Humor**: Every wish backfires in creative, devastating ways
- **📱 Responsive Design**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile
- **🎨 Atmospheric UI**: Dark fortune teller theme with mystical ambiance
- **🔄 Contextual Wishes**: Later wishes build on previous consequences
- **✋ Visual Feedback**: Animated monkey paw with closing fingers

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript
- **Backend**: PHP (for secure API key handling)
- **AI**: Google Gemini API
- **Styling**: Custom CSS with Google Fonts (Cinzel, Creepster)
- **Graphics**: Custom SVG illustrations

## 🚀 Quick Start

### For Local Development
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [your-repo-url]
cd MonkeyPaw

# Open directly in browser (limited functionality)
open index.html

# OR run with PHP server for full functionality
php -S localhost:8000
# Visit http://localhost:8000
```

### For WordPress/Shared Hosting Deployment
1. **Create a folder** in your public_html: `/public_html/monkeypaw/`
2. **Upload all files** maintaining the exact structure:
   - `index.html` 
   - `css/styles.css`
   - `images/monkey-paw.svg`
   - `api/gemini-proxy.php` (contains your API key - keep secure!)
3. **Set permissions**: Folders `755`, Files `644`
4. **Access your game**: `https://yoursite.com/monkeypaw/`
5. **Works immediately** - no additional setup needed!

## 🎯 How It Works

1. **Player makes a wish** through the chat interface
2. **Frontend sends request** to PHP backend with wish text and context
3. **PHP backend calls Gemini API** with carefully engineered prompts
4. **AI generates twisted response** that grants the wish with a terrible catch
5. **Finger closes** on the monkey paw, wishes counter decreases
6. **Game over** after 3 wishes, with option to restart

## 🔐 Security Features

- **API Key Protection**: Gemini API key is stored server-side only
- **Request Validation**: PHP backend validates all requests
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback responses when AI is unavailable
- **Rate Limiting**: Natural rate limiting through game mechanics

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

- **Dark Fortune Teller Aesthetic**: Inspired by mysterious, candlelit atmospheres
- **Cyanide & Happiness Art Style**: Simple but expressive visual design
- **No Scrolling Page**: Fixed viewport for immersive experience
- **Responsive Layout**: Adapts beautifully to all screen sizes

## 🧠 AI Prompt Engineering

The game uses sophisticated prompt engineering to ensure:
- **No player ever truly "wins"** - every wish has devastating consequences
- **Contextual responses** - later wishes build on previous ones
- **Creative interpretations** - literal twists, wordplay, and cruel irony
- **Consistent character** - maintains the malicious monkey paw persona

## 🌐 Deployment Guide

### Hostinger Deployment
1. **Access cPanel** from your Hostinger dashboard
2. **Open File Manager** and navigate to `public_html`
3. **Upload all project files** maintaining the directory structure
4. **Set permissions** (usually automatic on Hostinger)
5. **Test the game** by visiting your domain

### Requirements
- **PHP 7.4+** (for API backend)
- **cURL enabled** (for Gemini API calls)
- **Web server** (Apache/Nginx)
